## Geometric deep learning and graph neural networks

> _Deep learning on irregular data_ 

To get started on geometric deep learning, I recommend looking into the two libraries [PyTorch geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Deep Graph Library](https://www.dgl.ai/) (DGL).

You can find Colab notebooks introducing PyTorch geometric [here](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/colabs.html) and some additional examples [here](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric/tree/master/examples). Tutorials for DGL can be found [here](https://docs.dgl.ai/tutorials/blitz/index.html).  

The notebook `DL-torch_geometric.ipynb` can be used as a starting point if you want to experiment with PyTorch Geometric in Gradient.
