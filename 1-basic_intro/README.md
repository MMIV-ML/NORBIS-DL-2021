## Part 1: What is deep learning?

The notebooks of Part 1 accompany the introductory lecture. They are meant as an additional help for understanding the answers to _"What is deep learning?"_ and _"How do you _do_ deep learning?"_ for those unfamiliar with the field.

### Notebooks

* `DL-Example-1-image_classification-MedNIST-using-PyTorch.ipynb`. This notebook will provide a translation of the lecture's description of deep learning into PyTorch code, using a simple image classification example (the MedMIST data set collected by Dr. Bradley J. Erickson).

* `DL-Example-2-image_classification-MedNIST-MURA-using-fastai.ipynb`. This notebook repeats the above story by using more advanced image classification techniques, and also extends it to a much more difficult data set. Working through this notebook will give you a useful reference point for your further exploration of deep learning, and provide a bridge to the more advanced examples of Part 2.

### More 

If you feel like exploring the basics further, the accompanying lecture points at some resources. The most important recommendation is to _experiment_. _A lot!_ 

"Learning by doing" is a particularly good approach in such an experimental field as deep learning.
