## An introduction to practical deep learning

These notebooks take you on a guided tour through some of the practical deep learning landscape. See the accompanying lecture slides for an overview of the content. 

_Note that you can browse through the notebooks non-interactively using jupyter.org's nbviewer by clicking [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MMIV-ML/NORBIS-DL-2021/tree/master/2-intro_to_practical_dl)._


We'll meet the idea that non-image data can be turned into images that can be fed to computer vision-based models, use the fact that deep neural networks are representation learners to extract _task-specific representations_ of data, indicate the importance and usefulness of _fusing_ multiple sources of data when constructing predictive models, try out some basic techniques from _explainable AI_, stress the importance of _domain knowledge_ for data augmentation, and more. 

The notebooks have been designed to work on Paperspace Gradient. For workshop participants, please use the Team set up at Paperspace to get access to more powerful computing resources and to avoid having to redownload data. Instructions to join the team will be shared in the lecture.
