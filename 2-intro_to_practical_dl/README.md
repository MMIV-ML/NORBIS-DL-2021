## An introduction to practical deep learning

These notebooks take you on a guided tour through some of the practical deep learning landscape. See the accompanying lecture slides for an overview of the content. 

We'll meet the idea that non-image data can be turned into images that can be fed to computer vision-based models, use the fact that deep neural networks are representation learners to extract task-specific representations of data, indicate the importance and usefulness of _fusing_ multiple sources of data when constructing predictive models, try out some basic techniques from _explainable AI_, stress the importance of domain knowledge for data augmentation, and more.
