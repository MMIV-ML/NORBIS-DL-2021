Deep learning for tabular data (think spreadsheets and the like) isn't as established as computer vision or NLP, but there are several examples of successful implementations based on _embeddings_. 

The notebook ***TBA*** takes you on a quick tour, based on the [fastai](https://docs.fast.ai/) library. The fastai [documentation](https://docs.fast.ai/) has more details, and you'll find a more comprehensive example in fastai's [fastbook repo](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook).
