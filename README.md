# Deep learning in computational biology and medicine, NORBIS 2021

> Alexander S. Lundervold, https://alexander.lundervold.com. 

The repo contains the code used in the deep learning workshop of the NORBIS course [Genomics for precision imaging](https://norbis.w.uib.no/genomics-for-precision-medicine/), June 16th, 2021.

The module gives a quick introduction to some core features of deep learning, provide hands-on experience with image-, text- and graph-based applications, and do a guided tour of some useful tools and techniques of practical deep learning in biotechnology and medicine. 

It has two parts:

## Part 1 
Part 1 will be an introduction to deep learning essentially from skratch. The main takeaway and learning outcome will be that
> _Deep learning is a search for good hierarchical representations..._

...that makes a given task easy to solve. The objective is to get everyone on board with this description of deep learning, indicate why and when deep learning can be useful, and stress the importance of _domain knowledge_ in all parts of an applied deep learning-based project pipeline. I will also provide hands-on experience with how this translates into computer code (using PyTorch) via some concrete, simple examples.

## Part 2
In Part 2 we'll change gears and fly through some more involved examples. The goal is to expose you to some of the many ideas, techniques and tricks in modern deep learning. Those of you who are new to the field will hopefully get a useful impression of practical deep learning, with some pointers for learning more. Others more experienced in deep learning will perhaps learn some new tricks, and be exposed to some interesting approaches and applications. 

## Notebooks

_You can browse through the notebooks non-interactively using jupyter.org's nbviewer by clicking [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MMIV-ML/NORBIS-DL-2021/tree/master/)._

### Part 1: What is deep learning?
* `DL-Example-1-image_classification-MedNIST-using-PyTorch.ipynb`. This notebook will provide a translation of the lecture's description of deep learning into PyTorch code, using a simple image classification example (the MedMIST data set collected by Dr. Bradley J. Erickson).

</a>

* `DL-Example-2-image_classification-MedNIST-MURA-using-fastai.ipynb`. This notebook repeats the above story by using more advanced image classification techniques, and also extends it to a much more difficult data set. Working through this notebook will give you a useful reference point for your further exploration of deep learning, and provide a bridge to the more advanced examples of Part 2.
