# Deep learning in computational biology and medicine, NORBIS 2021

> Alexander S. Lundervold, https://alexander.lundervold.com. 

The repo contains the code used in the deep learning workshop of the NORBIS course [Genomics for precision imaging](https://norbis.w.uib.no/genomics-for-precision-medicine/), June 16th, 2021.

The workshop gives a quick introduction to some core features of deep learning, provide hands-on experience with image-, text- and graph-based applications, and takes you on a guided tour of some useful tools and techniques of practical deep learning in biotechnology and medicine. 

It has two parts:

## Part 1 
Part 1 will be an introduction to deep learning essentially from skratch. The main takeaway and learning outcome will be that
> _Deep learning is a search for good hierarchical representations..._

...that makes a given task easy to solve. The objective is to get everyone on board with this description of deep learning, indicate why and when deep learning can be useful, and stress the importance of _domain knowledge_ in all parts of an applied deep learning-based project pipeline. I will also provide hands-on experience with how this translates into computer code (using PyTorch) via some concrete, simple examples.

See [1-basic_intro](./1-basic_intro) for the accompanying notebooks. 

## Part 2
In Part 2 we'll change gears and fly through some more involved examples. The goal is to expose you to some of the many ideas, techniques and tricks in modern deep learning. Those of you who are new to the field will hopefully get a useful impression of practical deep learning, with some pointers for learning more. Others more experienced in deep learning will perhaps learn some new tricks, and be exposed to some interesting approaches and applications. 

We'll go through parts of the notebooks in [2-intro_to_practial_dl](./2-intro_to_practical_dl) together, after which you're free to explore various aspects of the field on your own. The links and notebooks in [3-nlp](./3-nlp), [4-geometric-dl](./4-geometric-dl) and [5-tabular-dl](./5-tabular-dl) can be used as convenient starting points (the notebooks have been prepared to run on Paperspace Gradient or Google Colaboratory).
