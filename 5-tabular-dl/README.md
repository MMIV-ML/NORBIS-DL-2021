## Tabular data and deep learning

Deep learning for tabular data (think spreadsheets and the like) isn't as established as computer vision or NLP, but there are several examples of successful implementations based on _embeddings_. 

The fastai library is at the forefront of the development of deep learning-based tabular data analysis (while also supporting "standard" machine learning models). Check out the fastai [documentation](https://docs.fast.ai/), and also the more comprehensive example in fastai's [fastbook repo](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook).
